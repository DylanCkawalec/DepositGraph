### Enigma Protocol Integration

The DepositGraph program incorporates the Enigma protocol to enhance security and privacy. The Enigma protocol features:

1. **Symmetric Zero-Knowledge Manifold Agreement**:
   - Unbreakable agreement between two opposing language sets.
   - Ensures that no two language sets can find commonality, making the key unique to the administrator.

2. **Multi-Chain Voting Booth**:
   - Supports Zero Sudo Cloud Operation.
   - Facilitates bill refinancing and yield generation.

3. **Collaborative Server Security**:
   - Utilizes a multi-party agreement with parallel server feeds.
   - Requires minimal compute resources and focuses on program protection.
   - Prevents any single administrator from controlling the server, ensuring distributed security.

4. **Rosario Proof**:
   - Unique proof submission that cannot be replicated.
   - Involves complex language sets to create a highly secure passkey.
   - The passkey's complexity ensures it is nearly impossible to decrypt, enhancing overall security.

These features make the Enigma protocol a robust addition to the DepositGraph program, providing advanced security measures for confidential operations.
